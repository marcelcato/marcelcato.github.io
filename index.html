      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>
        I'm a Politics student at NYU, passionate about public service, diplomacy, and equitable urban development.
        As a first-generation college student from a single-parent immigrant household, I've grown committed to building systems that nurture potential.
        I’ve worked across nonprofit leadership, alumni relations, and election operations — each step preparing me for a future in public leadership.
